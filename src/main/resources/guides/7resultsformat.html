            Numeric results generated by MIA workflows are exported to Excel spreadsheets. By default, each time a
            workflow is run, the results for all images processed will be collected into a single spreadsheet, however,
            this behaviour can be changed such that each input file generates its own spreadsheet.
            <br /><br />
            Output results files can contain multiple, highly configurable sheets. Typically, a results file will
            include a <a href="#summary_sheet">summary sheet</a> with one row per input image, individual <a
                href="#object_sheets">object sheets</a> with one row per detected
            object and a couple of <a href="#record_sheets">record-keeping sheets</a>.
            <br /><br />
            The output file format is configured in the <a href="${PATH_MODULE_OUTPUTCONTROL}">"Output control"</a>
            module.

    <div class="mia-text-block mx-auto" id="summary_sheet">
        <p class="mia-heading">Summary sheet</p>
        <div class="mia-main-text text-left">
            <ul>
                <li>The summary sheet is intended to provide a quick overview of the measurements contained within the
                    individual object sheets. Information is broken down into four classes of column.
                    <ul>
                        <li>By default, each row of the summary sheet will summarise the results from a single input
                            image.
                        <li>By changing the "Summary mode" parameter of the <a
                                href="${PATH_MODULE_OUTPUTCONTROL}">"Output control"</a> module to "Per timepoint per
                            input file", a new row can be generated for each timepoint in the image, allowing for quick
                            analysis of time-dependent processes.</li>
                        <li>Alternatively, by setting this to "Group by metadata", results can be grouped by a specific
                            metadata item, with one row per unique metadata value.</li>
                </li>
            </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Metadata values:
                <ul>
                    <li>Record input file-specified properties, such as filenames and series numbers.</li>
                    <li>These are important for result filtering and sorting, since results from multiple files may
                        be included in a single results file.</li>
                    <li>Column headings simply state the name of the metadata item.</li>
                    <li>Metadata columns can be enabled/disabled using the "Ind" controls in the "Output control"
                        module.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Image measurements:
                <ul>
                    <li>These columns record the individual measurements assigned to each object.</li>
                    <li>Columns headings are in the form:</li>
                    <p style="text-align: center;"><i>[Image name]_(IM) // [Measurement name]</i></p>
                    <li>For example, an image called "Binary" with the measurement "THRESHOLD // GLOBAL Huang" would
                        be called "Binary_(IM) // THRESHOLD // GLOBAL Huang".</li>
                    <li>Image measurements columns can be enabled/disabled using the "Ind" controls in the "Output
                        control" module.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Object counts:
                <ul>
                    <li>These simply state the number of objects of the specified class.</li>
                    <li>These have headers in the form:</li>
                    <p style="text-align: center;"><i>[Objects name]_(OBJ) // NUMBER</i></p>
                    <li>For example, for the count of detected "Nuclei" objects, this would be "Nuclei_(OBJ) //
                        NUMBER".</li>
                    <li>Object count columns can be enabled/disabled using the "Show object counts" control in the
                        "Output control" module. Object counts are either on
                        or off for all objects.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Object measurement statistics:
                <ul>
                    <li>Since multiple objects may be detected for an input file, each with their own measurements,
                        these columns provide a single summary measurement statistic.</li>
                    <li>Headers for these values are in the form:</li>
                    <p style="text-align: center;"><i>[Objects name]_(OBJ_[Statistic]) // [Measurement name]</i></p>
                    <li>For example, the header corresponding to the mean of the "SHAPE // N_VOXELS" measurement for
                        "Nuclei" objects would be "Nuclei_(OBJ_MEAN) // SHAPE // N_VOXELS".</li>
                    <li>Supported statistics are the mean ("MEAN"), minimum ("MIN"), maximum ("MAX"), standard deviation
                        ("STD") and sum ("SUM").</li>
                    <li>Object measurement statistic columns can be enabled/disabled using the "Mean", "Min", "Max",
                        "Sum" and "Std" controls in the "Output control" module. The "Ind" control determines if the
                        measurement appears in the object-specific results
                        sheet.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            </ul>
        </div>

    <div class="mia-text-block mx-auto" id="object_sheets">
        <p class="mia-heading">Object sheets</p>
        <div class="mia-main-text text-left">
            <ul>
                <li>The individual object sheets include the individual measurements for each detected object. Each row
                    of an object results sheet corresponds to a single detected object.</li>
                <li>The first column is always ("OBJECT_ID"), which is the unique ID number for that object in that
                    analysis run.
                    <ul>
                        <li>Note: IDs are only unique to that analysis run, so if multiple input files were processed,
                            the same ID numbers will likely appear.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>As with the <a href="#summary_sheet">summary sheet</a>, each row has columns for file-specific
                    metadata items as well as a column for each exported measurement.</li>
                <li>Metadata and measurement columns can be disabled with the "Ind" controls in the "Output control"
                    module.</li>

            <ul>
                <li>The final two sheets are always record-keeping sheets. These are useful for retaining knowledge of
                    how a workflow was run (e.g. plugin version) as well as seeing if any errors occurred during
                    execution.</li>
                <li>The "Configuration" sheet includes some device-specific information such as the computer operating system, plugin version and date/time of execution.  It also includes a full copy of the .mia workflow file used.  In the event of the workflow file being lost, these rows can be copied into a text file and saved with the .mia extension.</li>
                <li>The "Log" sheet contains a list of any error messages encountered during the analysis run.  All being well, this sheet should be empty.</li>
