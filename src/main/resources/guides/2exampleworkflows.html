                Example workflows for MIA can be found in the <a href="https://github.com/mianalysis/mia-examples">mia-examples</a> repository.  These introduce various processes of MIA such as image loading, object segmentation, object measurements and relationships and visualisation.  Each example contains the necessary files to get it running: the example workflow, any raw images required and any example outputs that are generated by the workflow.
                <br /><br />
                Each module in these workflows includes a corresponding set of notes summarising the purpose of that module and its configuration.  These notes can be viewed by enabling the "Notes" panel ("View > Show notes panel" from the MIA menu) and selecting a module from the list of modules in <a href="${PATH_EDITINGVIEW}">"editing view"</a>.
                <br /><br />
                While these workflows correspond to a specific analysis, the principles covered (i.e. image loading, processing, object detection and measurements) are applicable to most workflows.
                <br /><br />
                Note: Any object outlines in the generated "overlay" images will typically only be visible when opened in ImageJ/Fiji.
