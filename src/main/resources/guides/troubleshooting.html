        <div class="mia-main-text">MIA is in ongoing development and from time-to-time, issues may arise. Below are
            listed some common problems and solutions. For any problems not covered in the table (or if you have
            concerns something isn't working correctly), please submit an <a

                    <td>Certain modules require specific versions of other plugins to be installed. The warning message
                        should list the required version of that plugin. You can check what version of a plugin is
                        currently installed by looking in the "plugins" folder of your Fiji installation.</td>

                        ensure the workflow operates as intended, it's advisable to install the same version of MIA as
                        that used to prepare the workflow. Subsequent lines of this warning should indicate the version
                        used to create the workflow.</td>

                        removed. Similarly, if the workflow is from a newer version of MIA, this module may not yet have
                        been added. To fix this, install the MIA version matching that used to create the workflow.</td>
